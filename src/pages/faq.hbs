  <p class="lead">Will we know how many wolves there are?</p>
  <p>No. All roles are described on the <a href="rules.html">rules page</a>, but players will not know the initial Werewolf or Villager counts. The majority of players will be normal Villagers.</p>

  <p class="lead">Can players have more than one role?</p>
  <p>Players will be assigned no more than one special role by the moderator. There is an exception where a Werewolf is unknowingly assigned as a Lover by the Cupid.</p>

  <p class="lead">Can the Werewolves turn Villagers into more Werewolves?</p>
  <p>No, the roles will not change once the game starts.</p>

  <p class="lead">What happens if there are two Villagers tied with the most votes for hanging?</p>
  <p>The Villagers can't reach a decision and no one is lynched that evening.</p>

  <p class="lead">Can Villagers vote NOT to hang someone?</p>
  <p>Yes. You may explicitly vote not to hang someone that evening.</p>

  <p class="lead">Can I change my vote?</p>
  <p>If you vote more than once, your most recent vote before 4:30pm is counted.</p>

  <p class="lead">When will I know the result of my role's special ability?</p>
  <p>All villager votes, wolf kills, and special ability targets are submitted before 4:30pm. Any results or new information will be provided at the same time the next morning around 9am EST.</p>
