  <p class="lead">Day 6: A Hail Mary</p>
  <p>The past few days had been a bloodbath and only a few townsfolk remained. Prospects for Joistown civilization had been lost and it was decided the final showdown would take place in a cage match centred on the square. Loose boards and barrels, and all kinds of rubble were piled high at the square's exits and lit ablaze. There was no escape. Kill or be killed.</p>
  <p>The fighting was fierce in this apocalyptic setting, and Dave & Dennis found themselves positioned to the middle of the other four pairs.</p>
  <p>"Give it up Dave, and you too Dennis! Show us your true form already so that we might see you laid to rest as you truly are!" declared Kota. Katz backed him up, "Yeah!"</p>
  <p>Dave & Dennis fired back, "You're evil, all of you. We're no werewolves, it must be one of you!"</p>
  <p>D&D were set upon and smashed to the cobblestone, deader than dead.</p>
  <p>Boisterous laughing filled the flaming square. Ryan, Sandeep, Shaider, and Sharon all transformed. They grew, and sprouted whiskers and long fangs. Dami looked on horrified.</p>
  <p>Sharon grabbed Kota and Sandeep bit into Katz. They died gruesomely as Ryan and Shaider moved in on Dami. Dami whirled out his bow and arrow and slayed Shaider in a single shot right between the eyes. Sharon ROARRED and lunged, but was lashed aside by Dami's whipping of his bow. He loosed another arrow to Sharon' heart.</p>
  <p>The only townsfolk standing at this point were Dami, and Ryan & Sandeep. The two werewolves rushed Dami and had their final snack before moving onto the next village.</p>
  <p>THE END.</p>
  <p><i>Werewolves win üèÜ: Ryan, Sandeep, Shaider, Sharon</i></p>
  <p><i>Next time for the Villagers ü§ù: Aldona, Aleks, Dami, Dave, Dennis, Elua, Jason, Katz, Kota, Matthew I, Matt S, Paul, Peter, Sunny, Sushani, Tunji, Valeriy, Vidhi, Wendy</i></p>

  <p class="lead">Day 5: Get Yer Torches</p>
  <p>By late evening the majority of Villagers were all fired up with pitchforks and torches ablaze. They'd taken to the streets as a mob and were out for blood. The prevailing theory was that the werewolves were living within the town's perimeter and they needed to be proactive about snuffing them out.
  <p>Sunny meanwhile continued to campaign aggressively for Mayor after hearing Dami had stepped up to provide some healthy competition. The two stood on opposing sides of the square, shouting their slogans:</p>
  <p>Sunny: THE DAWN IS COMING!</p>
  <p>Dami: WOLFHUNTERS, ENGAGE!</p>
  <p>The mob was simulatenously inspired by Sunny's optimism for peace, as well as Dami's call to violence which would get them there.</p>
  <p>Valeriy wandered the crowds, pleading for an oracle to join him in investigating some of the more vocal townies. A dishevelled and possibly intoxicated vagrant approached him. "My good greetings sir. *hic* I understand you are searching for a mystic? Perhaps you'd be interested in this?" The man reached deeply into the inner pocket of his coat and produced a slightly scuffed up crystal ball. It looked rather filthy, but Valeriy's eyes widened.</p>
  <p>"My goodness, that is a crystal ball! You must let me have it!" exclaimed Valeriy.</p>
  <p>"You're welcome to it! In exchange for... fifty dollars."</p>
  <p>Valeriy hastily produced some cash and practically threw it at the man, who handed him the crystal ball in turn. Valeriy immediately called over Tunji to show him what he'd found. They crouched down on the cobblestone and gave the ball a gentle polish. Smoky reflections swirled inside the orb, but it was difficult to make out the shapes which were struggling to form. A purplish-green glow beckoned others nearby to crowd in around it.</p>
  <p>Tunji stood up. "It is showing us nothing," he muttered. "Seek not direction from this strange talisman, for its wisdom is empty. Look inside yourself for a fountain of true guidance that spills."</p>
  <p>The onlookers couldn't make out anything in the ball either.</p>
  <p>"What did he say?"</p>
  <p>"I think he said <i>Matt Kills!</i>"</p>
  <p>"No, I was explaining about our inner fountain of wisdom <i>That Spills</i>," clarified Tunji.</p>
  <p>"<i>MATT KILLS?</i> Which Matt?? We've got two of those? Or maybe three? No, two for sure."</p>
  <p>"This ain't no time to be messin about, let's git em both!"</p>
  <p>Hoots and hollers led the charge for one Matt's house on the west side of town with a coastal view of the sea, as well as the other Matt's house somewhere near the big lake. The murderings didn't take long as both Matts were vastly outnumbered. They eventually fell to the mob as one might expect of any lone human being.</p>
  <p>Valeriy remained in the square, still hunched over the crystal ball. "This has to work! I see some shadows or something happening!" He thought he was talking to Tunji, but Tunji had already been eaten. The shadows grew beyond the crystal ball and enveloped Valeriy as well. He was consumed by the darkness of wolves.</p>
  <p>---</p>
  <p>The next day, Liz had published another collection of compassionately-written obituaries, which Sunny & Sushani took turns reading to each other as they set up tables and brewed fresh pots in their cafe. Sushani stopped short on one of them, "I- I can't believe it. Tunji... AND Valeriy... they're dead!"</p>
  <p>"What? No. No... NOOOOOOOOOOOO" cried Sunny up toward the ceiling.</p>
  <p>The two of them sobbed uncontrollably, hearts breaking in tandem. They were found dead by their first customer of the day.</p>

  <p class="lead">Day 4: Not So Nice To Meet You</p>

  <p>Aldona and Aleks were sitting idly on a park bench as random townsfolk walked by going about their business.</p>
  <p>"Oh that delivery man over there. And the flower shop girl- they'd would make a good couple, don't you think?", said Aleks.</p>
  <p>"Yes! I can definitely see it. That's a match," Aldona agreed.</p>
  <p>"What about that woman jogging?"</p>
  <p>"For the delivery guy? No way. Too serious looking. The flower girl is the one, she's a total snack."</p>
  <p>They'd been at it most of the afternoon and a few passerbys began to think the way they were staring at everyone was suspicious. Bits and pieces of their conversations gave some the idea they were sizing up victims for a meal. The girls were eventually confronted.</p>
  <p>"What exactly are you ladies doing out here?" asked a very large man, accompanied by a half dozen other rough looking individuals.</p>
  <p>"Oh, we're just people watching. It's fun to match people together."</p>
  <p>"Match people together?"</p>
  <p>"Yeah! Like that bus driver right there, I bet he'd love to have that park gardener over there for dinner. We like to secretly make it happen for people."</p>
  <p>"For dinner you say? Damn you sickos for terrorizing our quiet little town-"</p>
  <p>Arms grabbed Aldona & Aleks and they were yanked backwards over the bench and onto the ground. They were dragged over to a large tree nearby and ropes were thrown over a sturdy branch.</p>
  <p>"No no, you're making a big mistake! We bring only love!"</p>
  <p>They were hoisted up and jiggled around in completely human form. The group of goons watched and waited for something to happen, but nothing did. They scurried away before anyone could see what they'd done.</p>
  <p>---</p>
  <p>The lamplighters were just finishing up with the last few streetlights, giving the town a beautifully eerie nighttime glow. Jason walked into the middle of the square with Eula following behind apprehensively. She fidgeted with the strap of her shoulder bag, "I'm not so sure this is a good idea, Jason."</p>
  <p>"Nonsense," Jason stated dismissively and cupped his hands to his mouth: "Werewooooolves! Come on out! Weeeeeeerewolves... we promise we only want to talk!"</p>
  <p>"See, there's no one coming. The werewolves aren't here. Let's go."</p>
  <p>"Oh but we are here," said a voice from behind them. They turned to see an enormous werebeast towering over them, licking its lips. "What was it you only wanted to talk about?"</p>
  <p>"Uhhhh, we were, uhhh, expecting you to come by in your human form. Y'know, so we could talk through what it is you want exactly. Maybe wrap this panicked townsfolk situation up for everyone."</p>
  <p>"What do I want... well it's quite simple really. And I think you know what it is. TO EAT YOU ALL."</p>
  <p>Eula screamed and shoved Jason to the ground as she made her getaway out of the square. Jason's gurgles could be heard behind her and she made it down a side street. Another enormously furry figure stepped out from the shadows in front of her. "There's no escape you know. It's only a matter of time before we get you all."</p>
  <p>Eula screamed again but it was cut short by the werewolf pouncing down on her neck like a mountain lion on a deer. Eula's bag fell to the ground and a peculiar ball of crystal rolled out and through the growing pool of blood.</p>

  <p class="lead">Day 3: Vote For Pedro</p>
  <p>Election season was in full swing, as several ambitious Joistownies sought to fill the town's mayoral vacuum. Posters went up and handbills littered the cobblestones of the town square. Rallys were held and speeches were given- order and peace would soon return!</p>
  <p>There was however one gathering which was not advertising the same optimism as the others. It was a demonstration of fear and hatred. Speakers clamored for an aggressive response to what the other "sheep" had been brushing off as a silly werewolf conspiracy. The names Vidhi & Wendy came up as persons of interest and a mob broke out to find them. It didn't take long, and they were dragged out to the gallows in the town square. But there was uncertainty whether the executioner was out of office that day, or at least paying attention. But he was! Mostly! Out came the nooses and poor Vidhi & Wendy were strung up. They dangled for a bit, and perished, but no indications of supernatural werewolfness were observed.</p>
  <p>Nightfall fell again, and a group of townsfolk transformed once more into werewolves on the edge of town. They approached Paul & Peter's apartment more cautiously this time and cut the power at the back of the building. Knowing the alarms and lights were disabled, they crept into the lobby where the doorman was still nowhere to be found. They rode the elevators up to every floor and gobbled up each apartment's occupants one by one. Paul & Peter were unable to defend themselves as they slept.</p>

  <p class="lead">Day 2: Watch Your Back</p>

  <p>The town descended quickly into chaos now that their leadership had been eliminated. People weren't exactly willing to speak openly, but accusations flowed freely behind closed doors and inside dingy basements. Long-simmering personal grievances fueled escalating threats of violence.</p>
  <p>"Someone's been stealing from my pumpkin patch and I KNOW it's those Ryan & Sandeep punks running around out all night probably. They're suspicious as all hell and I've had it up to here with their no good ways!"</p>
  <p>"I just found out I've been overpaying for my morning coffee for months! Damn are those decaf soy lattes ever tasty, and I was happy to pay $4, but then Bill tells me Sunny & Sushani have only been charging him $3?! Outrageous! What do they think of me?! That cafe of theirs should be burned to the ground with them in it!"</p>
  <p>Despite some hysterics, no one managed to galvanize a large enough group to take action. It was all bark and no bite, for now.</p>
  <p>Nightfall fell, and some townsfolk did go out to meet on the edge of town. They transformed under light of the moon and set out for a midnight snack. Paul & Peter's apartment building was quiet and peaceful as the beasts approached with speed then burst into the lobby entrance. There was no doorman there at his post, but luckily it would seem that someone had configured a security alarm to guard and protect Paul & Peter's home as they slept. Sirens and lights went off with blistering volume and flash. The werewolves recoiled and dashed back out into the night.</p>

  <p class="lead">Day 1: Enough Is Enough</p>

  <p>Mayor Wilkins squeezes his way through the crowd, weaving toward the edge of the fountain at the center of the Square. It looks like everyone's come out this morning. There would be much to discuss. Wilkins had read the coroner's report, and wasn't certain how much of it he should actually share. The document's medically precise account of the incident at Theresa Townsman's house was too disturbing to even consider repeating. That poor boy.</p>
  <p>"My fellow Joistonians! Today I am filled with a profound sadness. As I'm sure you've all heard by now, there was an unfortunate incident the other night involving a local mother and her child. We are still investigating the facts, but I am here before you today to confirm that the mother has unfortunately succumbed to her injuries sustained while resisting arrest. I can assure you that our town is safe and everything is under control."</p>
  <p>"<i>UNDER CONTROL??</i>", a voice roars from the crowd, "I heard she was DISEASED and OUTTA control! How do we know this isn't going to happen again?!"</p>
  <p>"My friends, my friends... I know these have been challenging times for all of us. Please try to remain calm and allow your leadership to handle this. We are expecting-"</p>
  <p>A chunk of Town Square brick thwops the Mayor in his chest, knocking him into the fountain with a splash.</p>
  <p>"We've been waiting months and months for relief! It's time to take matters into our own hands!", continues the anonymous voice as the crowd erupts into an unruly mob.</p>
  <p>A different, even louder voice pipes in, "We all knew Theresa Townsman, let's stop the dancin around it. That dog attack changed her, and it weren't no mutt... it were one of them WEREWOLVES! You politico bastards are probably ALL WEREWOLVES."</p>
  <p>Arms thrust forward and haul the now shrieking Mayor out of the water by his lapels. He is dragged toward the old gallows nearby...</p>
  <p>"We'll hang em all ourselves before they get us at night!"</p>

  <p class="lead">Day 0: It Begins</p>

  <p>An agitated howl in the distance reminds Timmy Townsman he's long since run out of time for scavenging deadfall. He hasn't been having much luck this evening anyway... the woods not far from the edge of town have been completely picked over for weeks now. He looks at the few meager branches he's managed to find and decides they'll have to do. Besides, his ailing mother would be anxiously awaiting his return before nightfall.</p>
  <p>The past few months have been particularly hard on the residents of Joistown. Local farmland has been producing less and less food and the people are hangry. Economic activity has slowed to a halt, and it's uncommon to see people congregating outside of their immediate households.
  <p>Timmy manages to make it home and through the door just as the final rays of sunlight evaporate beyond the horizon. The woodstove provides enough of a faint glow to see his mother has managed to tuck herself into bed. She is restless and appears in the midst of another feverish nightmare. Timmy wets a towel at the sink and presses it gently to her forehead. Her physical recovery since the dog attack seems on the right track, but she has been taking on more and more extreme emotional states at night.</p>
  <p>The woodstove flickers- Timmy's cue to feed it another branch. He reminds himself to carefully ration the wood so it lasts until morning. Crouched down by the stove, he brings it back to life, causing new shadows to dance strangely across the room. He turns, and sees his mother towering suddenly over him, twisted and wild-eyed. It's his mother alright, but she's become nearly unrecognizable to Timmy. The glow of the room turns to darkness.</p>
  <p>---</p>
  <p style="color:red">YOU are a resident of Joistown. There is a meeting at the town square, Monday morning at 9am EST, to discuss what is to be done about what was discovered at the Townsman residence.</p>
