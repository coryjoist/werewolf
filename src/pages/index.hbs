  <p class="lead">Day 1: Enough Is Enough</p>

  <p>Mayor Wilkins squeezes his way through the crowd, weaving toward the edge of the fountain at the center of the Square. It looks like everyone's come out this morning. There would be much to discuss. Wilkins had read the coroner's report, and wasn't certain how much of it he should actually share. The document's medically precise account of the incident at Theresa Townsman's house was too disturbing to even consider repeating. That poor boy.</p>
  <p>"My fellow Joistonians! Today I am filled with a profound sadness. As I'm sure you've all heard by now, there was an unfortunate incident the other night involving a local mother and her child. We are still investigating the facts, but I am here before you today to confirm that the mother has unfortunately succumbed to her injuries sustained while resisting arrest. I can assure you that our town is safe and everything is under control."</p>
  <p>"<i>UNDER CONTROL??</i>", a voice roars from the crowd, "I heard she was DISEASED and OUTTA control! How do we know this isn't going to happen again?!"</p>
  <p>"My friends, my friends... I know these have been challenging times for all of us. Please try to remain calm and allow your leadership to handle this. We are expecting-"</p>
  <p>A chunk of Town Square brick thwops the Mayor in his chest, knocking him into the fountain with a splash.</p>
  <p>"We've been waiting months and months for relief! It's time to take matters into our own hands!", continues the anonymous voice as the crowd erupts into an unruly mob.</p>
  <p>A different, even louder voice pipes in, "We all knew Theresa Townsman, let's stop the dancin around it. That dog attack changed her, and it weren't no mutt... it were one of them WEREWOLVES! You politico bastards are probably ALL WEREWOLVES."</p>
  <p>Arms thrust forward and haul the now shrieking Mayor out of the water by his lapels. He is dragged toward the old gallows nearby...</p>
  <p>"We'll hang em all ourselves before they get us at night!"</p>

  <p class="lead">Day 0: It Begins</p>

  <p>An agitated howl in the distance reminds Timmy Townsman he's long since run out of time for scavenging deadfall. He hasn't been having much luck this evening anyway... the woods not far from the edge of town have been completely picked over for weeks now. He looks at the few meager branches he's managed to find and decides they'll have to do. Besides, his ailing mother would be anxiously awaiting his return before nightfall.</p>
  <p>The past fifteen months have been particularly hard on the residents of Joiston. Local farmland has been producing less and less food and the people are hangry. Economic activity has slowed to a halt, and it's uncommon to see people congregating outside of their immediate households.
  <p>Timmy manages to make it home and through the door just as the final rays of sunlight evaporate beyond the horizon. The woodstove provides enough of a faint glow to see his mother has managed to tuck herself into bed. She is restless and appears in the midst of another feverish nightmare. Timmy wets a towel at the sink and presses it gently to her forehead. Her physical recovery since the dog attack seems on the right track, but she has been taking on more and more extreme emotional states at night.</p>
  <p>The woodstove flickers- Timmy's cue to feed it another branch. He reminds himself to carefully ration the wood so it lasts until morning. Crouched down by the stove, he brings it back to life, causing new shadows to dance strangely across the room. He turns, and sees his mother towering suddenly over him, twisted and wild-eyed. It's his mother alright, but she's become nearly unrecognizable to Timmy. The glow of the room turns to darkness.</p>
