  <p class="lead">Day 1: A New Death</p>
  <p>Everyone entered Town Square and apparently there must have been a sale at Home Depot as everyone had a new tool of choice. Most had pitchforks but obviously they had sold out as one person had brought a rake (for raking leaves). It wasn’t going to be as effective BUT their town spirit was evident.</p>
  <p>“Go TEAM Villagers” one screamed. A chant – started by Matthew – of “Let’s go Villagers, let’s go” could be heard building along the edge of the square. Some considered starting “the wave” but most people stayed focused on the task at hand.</p>
  <p>People were out for blood and it seemed someone would surely be hanged this day.</p>
  <p>One group spoke:</p>
  <p>Clearly, this person, there, pointing to a non-gender specific person, they are the werewolf and must be hanged. While a second group exclaimed “No, this other person (also coincidently without gender specified) is the werewolf and THEY must be hanged. For a moment, the group was at an impasse. “I know!” one person said. Yang can help break this tie.</p>
  <p>As people looked around for Yang, they realized he wasn’t in the square. “I’ll go get him” said another non-descript townsperson. Don’t go alone others exclaimed.</p>
  <p>A knock at Yang’s front door brought no sound from inside. Upon entry to Yang’s place, the Villagers found what was left of Yang’s body. It was clear that Yang had made a run for it and had put up a good fight but was ultimately overwhelmed by the werewolves.</p>
  <p>Without Yang’s vote, no one broke the tie so no one was hanged.</p>
  <p>What will the townsfolk do?</p>

  <p class="lead">Day 0: A New Dawn</p>

  <p>Several years had passed and the town of Joiston had changed a lot. In fact, everyone that you might have known before as residents of Joiston had left the town. Any people now, although they might have the same name as someone from before, are not the same people. In addition, there are several new faces in town.</p>
  <p>Misery has visited Joiston again. This time it seems it has been a pack of wild dogs that live on the outskirts of town and roam the streets at night. There had been many close calls and these dogs have become confident, emboldened perhaps.</p>
  <p>As dawns breaks on this new day, we find a dead body in the square. As people exit their homes for the day, they exclaim “How could this have happened? We must do something about these dogs.”</p>
  <p>A passerby – let’s call him Jim for the purposes of the story – approaches the body and commands the attention of the townsfolk.</p>
  <p>“These are not dog bites!” Jim exclaimed! Many years ago when I lived here, Joiston was afflicted by wolves – WEREWOLVES. I thought we got rid of them then but it seems they’re back.</p>
  <p>What will the townsfolk do?</p>
