          <p class="lead">Day 1: You Have Your Assignments</p>
        
          <p>The coffee was nearly all poured out and seating was limited in the station briefing room. Detectives eyed each other quietly from the rows of tablet desks.</p>
          <p>"Listen up!"</p>
          <p>The Chief entered briskly from the entrance at the front of the room.</p>
          <p>"And close that door at the back there! Look, I know half of you just transferred in and don't know your beltbuckle from your anklebone, but we've got a real sick set of individuals out there on this one and no time for hand-holding."</p>
          <p>He produced a stack of papers from behind the podium at the front of the room, which were disseminated through the rows.</p>
          <p>"Homer Garfield, 32: attacked while jogging in Jubilee Park, dead. Oprah Jetson, 27, and her grandmother Wilma, 63: mauled in the supermarket in broad daylight! The list goes on... the circumstances of the scenes indicate multiple truly violent offenders working together. You'll see from these reports that we have virtually no leads at this time, which I'm counting on you for. A-S-A-P.</p>
          <p>As I'm sure you've also noticed by now, this department lacks the resources to formally partner you up as your orientation officer may have previously explained, but I expect you'll work together where you can. This room will be left open as a strategic point of information sharing. Now get the hell out of here and get me a suspect by 4:30!"</p>
          <p>---</p>
          <p>"EXTRA EXTRA! SERIAL KILLER COP ON THE LOOSE!"</p>
          <p>"Hey kid, gimme one a those."</p>
          <p>"Sure thing mister, that'll be a dime."</p>
          <div style="border: solid black 1px; background: white; padding: 10px;">
            <p><i>Joliet, M. (2022, June 8). KILLER COP. Joistown Evening Tribune, p. 1.</i></p>
            <p>Anonymous sources confirm a shred of bloodied fabric discovered near Homer Garfield's remains are a match with those used in standard issue police uniforms. Local PD continues to refuse comment, citing "ongoing investigations" as residents begin to gather outside of the department headquarters.</p>
            <p>Mayor Wilkins has issued a public statement calling for an immediate inquiry into all police whereabouts Tuesday evening, along with an inventory of all PD member uniforms and their present conditions.</p>
            <p>Stay tuned for nore new news as it brews, dear readers, care of your man on the street, Max Joliet.</p>

          <p class="lead">Day 0: Who Is Accounted For</p>
        
          <p>Stan Spade slotted the stack of crimescene photos back into their envelope and tossed the wad across his desk. This wasn't the usual flophouse fisticuffs gone wrong- <i>these stiffs was all shredded up like cheese on a grater</i>. The press was gonna eat this up once they found out, and he knew he'd have the Chief riding his keister 'til it got sorted.</p>
          <p>"Maybe I should leave these files right where I found em", Stan thought to himself. "Right there on the crummy desk. I'm getting too old for this... leave the badge, retire... maybe finally find a nice dame somewhere. Live the quiet life... aw who am I kiddin', that life ain't for me."</p>
          <p>Stan lit a cigarette, and thought about his next move. It was already late, and he knew he would need help on this one. But he also wasn't sure who he could trust. IA had been going hard on corruption in the force lately, and no one was exactly in a helpin' sort of mood.</p>
          <p>He heard what sounded like howling in the distance. It didn't quite sound like the wailing of a squadcar siren, but it was far enough away that who could tell.</p>
          <p>Stan tapped out his cig, put on his hat, grabbed his coat and headed for the door. He'd take a few days to think about the case, and which of the other detectives he could count on to not mess this one up. Hopefully it would stay out of the press until then.</p>
          <p>---</p>
          <p style="color:red">YOU are a criminal investigator with the Joistown PD. The Chief has called a meeting in the briefing room, Wednesday morning at 9am EST, to discuss a series of grisly homicides that were discovered this week.</p>
          <p>---</p>
          <p>The game will begin next Wednesday at 9:00am EST. If you choose to participate, DM or email Cory to confirm before end of day Friday. Iâ€™m anticipating we may have a large number of players, so you may be partnered up with another detective when working out your investigation.</p>
