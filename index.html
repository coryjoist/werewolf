          <p class="lead">Day 0: It Begins</p>
        
          <p>An agitated howl in the distance reminds Timmy Townsman he's long since run out of time for scavenging deadfall. He hasn't been having much luck this evening anyway... the woods not far from the edge of town have been completely picked over for weeks now. He looks at the few meager branches he's managed to find and decides they'll have to do. Besides, his ailing mother would be anxiously awaiting his return before nightfall.</p>
          <p>The past few months have been particularly hard on the residents of Joistown. Local farmland has been producing less and less food and the people are hangry. Economic activity has slowed to a halt, and it's uncommon to see people congregating outside of their immediate households.
          <p>Timmy manages to make it home and through the door just as the final rays of sunlight evaporate beyond the horizon. The woodstove provides enough of a faint glow to see his mother has managed to tuck herself into bed. She is restless and appears in the midst of another feverish nightmare. Timmy wets a towel at the sink and presses it gently to her forehead. Her physical recovery since the dog attack seems on the right track, but she has been taking on more and more extreme emotional states at night.</p>
          <p>The woodstove flickers- Timmy's cue to feed it another branch. He reminds himself to carefully ration the wood so it lasts until morning. Crouched down by the stove, he brings it back to life, causing new shadows to dance strangely across the room. He turns, and sees his mother towering suddenly over him, twisted and wild-eyed. It's his mother alright, but she's become nearly unrecognizable to Timmy. The glow of the room turns to darkness.</p>
          <p>---</p>
          <p style="color:red">YOU are a resident of Joistown. There is a meeting at the town square, Monday morning at 9am EST, to discuss what is to be done about what was discovered at the Townsman residence.</p>
          <p>---</p>
          <p>If you choose to participate, Slack @Cory to confirm right away.</p>
          <p>A game of Werewolf will take place beginning Monday morning, asynchronously over Slack. All players are randomly assigned a role of either Werewolf or Villager. Votes are submitted once daily anytime before 4:30pm EST until the game ends.</p>
          <p>More details around how to play will follow.</p>
